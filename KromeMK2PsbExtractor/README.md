# Krome MK2 psb Extractor

## Description
This script was written in an attempt to pull audio files from the soundbank archive format used by KromeStudios in their Merkury Engine V2. 

As of v1.0.0 the script successfully pulls the files from the soundbank and converts them to .raw files which can be encoded with audacity or any other program which aids in audio encoding. However, there is something still missing which is causing some files to be incorrect in length and all files to have a white noise sound layered heavily over the sound.
This will hopefully be fixed in the near future.

## Usage
`py extractor.py [input psb path] [output folder]`
